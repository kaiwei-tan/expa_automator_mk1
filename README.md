# expa_automator_mk1
Project done as part of my work as <i>Outgoing Exchange Manager</i> for <i>AIESEC in NUS</i>

This project aims to reduce workload of my Outgoing Exchange team through eliminating the need for manual data entry. Previously, this was done by manually checking our global CRM / information system (nicknamed EXPA) and entering related numbers in a spreadsheet for performance tracking.

Firstly, <b>"expa_leads.ipynb"</b> processes and cleans the data, obtained from the EXPA API and structured in NoSQL, keeping only the fields relevant to our daily processes. Then, <b>"expa_analytics.ipynb"</b> performs descriptive analytics and data visualization, providing customer insights e.g. referral source, sign-ups by month, product interest, etc, which the executive board of AIESEC in NUS can then refer to when making marketing-related decisions.
